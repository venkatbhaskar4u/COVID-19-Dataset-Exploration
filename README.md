# COVID-19 Dataset Exploration

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 datasets using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The workflow demonstrates essential data wrangling, visualization, and exploratory analytics skills, uncovering trends, patterns, and insights relevant to public health and epidemiological research.

## Key Features
- **Data Import & Cleaning:** Loads global or regional COVID-19 datasets, applies missing value imputation, and corrects formatting issues for reliable analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzes case counts, fatalities, recoveries, and testing rates across time and geography.
- **Trend & Pattern Discovery:** Visualizes infection spikes, seasonality, geographic clustering, and correlation with demographic or socioeconomic indicators.
- **Visualization:** Generates time-series plots, heatmaps, geospatial maps, and interactive charts using best-practice Python libraries.
- **Statistical Summaries:** Calculates key metrics (moving averages, growth rates, ratios) and presents summary statistics for data-driven decision making.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Optional: GeoPandas or Folium for advanced mapping

## Dataset
- Public COVID-19 datasets (e.g., Johns Hopkins University, WHO, Kaggle)
- Includes daily case counts, deaths, recoveries, region/country details

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/venkatbhaskar4u/COVID-19-Dataset-Exploration.git`
2. Install dependencies
3. Download the public COVID-19 dataset (or use notebook's automatic loader if provided).
4. Open `COVID_19_Dataset_Exploration.ipynb` in Jupyter and run cells to analyze, visualize, and interpret the data.

## Example Results
- Visualizes global and local case trajectories over time
- Identifies peak periods, lagging regions, and phases of decline or resurgence
- Presents summary tables and charts for comparative regional analysis

## Applications & Impact
- Supports public health decision-making, academic research, and situation reporting
- Demonstrates foundational data analysis and visualization skills for epidemiology and crisis analytics
- Builds skills relevant for roles in healthcare analytics, data science, and informatics
